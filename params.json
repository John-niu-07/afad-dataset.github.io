Abstract\r\n\r\nThe Asian Face Age Dataset (AFAD) is a new dataset proposed for evaluating the \r\nperformance of age estimation, which is collected from the RenRen Social Network.\r\nAccording to the birth data that RenRen Social Network requires users to provide,\r\nlabels can be generated.\r\n  \r\nCompared with other aging databases, e.g. FG-NET which contains about `1k` images,\r\nMORPH ALBUM II, which contains about `55k` images, the AFAD has `160k` images.\r\nAdditionally, there is few ASIAN FACE in the MORPH and FG-NET dataset, thus the \r\nAFAD is noticeable in terms of ethic.\r\n\r\n## 1.
